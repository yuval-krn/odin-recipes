    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My girlfriend and I enjoyed this simple, (relatively) healthy breakfast all throughout our summer. We were both working full time so it provided a quick, easy, and approachable outlet to appease our hunger.</p>
    <p>Feel free to swap out the breakfast sausage with any other protein of your choice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Breakfast Sausage</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Sourdough Bread</li>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook breakfast sausage in a heated pan, following package instructions.</li>
        <li>Remove sausage into plate, freeing pan up for the eggs.</li>
        <li>Add butter into the pan until the ancestors tell you to stop.</li>
        <li>Crack eggs directly into pan and mix, hoping for the best.</li>
        <li>While eggs cook, slice up your avocado and toast your bread.</li>
        <li>Once eggs have solidified, throw sausage briefly back in to heat up.</li>
        <li>Hit everything with salt and pepper, hot sauce for the boyfriend.</li>
        <li>Plate and enjoy :) </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is my favorite quick and easy pasta dish for those dinners in which you just want to have a cheap and delicious meal without working too hard.</p>
    <p>I've found it to be <em>very</em> modular, so swap out any of the extras with your own, change the protein up, say hi to a stranger! It's your life.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb of pasta</li>
        <li>1 lb of mushrooms</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Salt and boil water for the pasta, lowering to a simmer if it boils while preparing sauce.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil to pan, then add mushrooms.</li>
        <li>After a couple minutes, add onions.</li>
        <li>Cook until onions turn transluscent, then add garlic and beef.</li>
        <li>Hit the beef with a wooden spoon so it doesn't clump up while it cooks.</li>
        <li>Season until the ancestors tell you to stop.</li>
        <li>Bring water back to a boil and add pasta.</li>
        <li>Add heavy cream to pan, with the heat on high, letting it bubble and thicken as the pasta boils.</li>
        <li>Add parmesan, salt, and pepper into sauce.</li>
        <li>Strain pasta, mix with sauce, plate and enjoy :)</li>
    </ol>

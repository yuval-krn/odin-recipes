    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>You know 'em, you love 'em. Now you cook 'em.</p>

    <p>Honestly are these overhyped? I feel like when you get them at the fair, 
        they're always calling for something more. Perhaps some ice cream? Some sort of incredible dipping sauce?
        Left as a challenge for the reader.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Pancake mix</li>
        <li>Oreos</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk milk, egg, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain.</li>
        <li>Dip cookies into batter, one at a time, and carefully place into hot oil. Fry in batches, 4 or 5 at a time, until cookies are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.</li>
    </ol>
